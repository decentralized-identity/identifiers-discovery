<summary> Universal Resolver Work Item Call - <b>Wednesdays 0800 ET (discontinued)</b></summary>

<br>This weekly Work Item Call is dedicated to the [Universal Resolver](github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver) work item.
We discuss policy and governance topics (e.g. when to add/remove drivers), as well
as technical topics (e.g. integration with the W3C DID test suite, monitoring, analytics, etc.).

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Jolocom team] Current status of `did:keri`, and adding it as a work item to the ID WG.
    * Information and contextual documents: https://hackmd.io/@RYgJMHAGSlaLMaQzwYjvsQ/ByAYibtdF 
    * Current did:keri method specification: https://identity.foundation/keri/did_methods/
    * Quick intro to KERI
        * KERI defines a number of events (e.g. inception, rotation, delegated inception, etc.), and also data structures and rules for processing them. Processing events leads to the current state of the identifier.
        * There are different types of identifiers, and different ways how events can get exchanged, e.g. ephemeral mode, exchange with counterparty (direct mode), exchange via witnesses (indirect mode).
        * The controller can select what witnesses they like, witnesses can also be rotated. This adds an abstraction layer, witnesses can be anything (ledger, or personal server, etc.)
    * Current status of did:keri 
        * Previously there was did:un, some features were not yet supported. Jolocom had an implementation of direct mode, the intention was to use it on mobile wallets.
        * Then the intention was to switch from did:un to a more robust implementation of did:keri, using some good learnings from the initial experimentation work.
        * Some work is split across different environments, so besides a documentation effort there also needs to be some alignment.
        * The goal is to continue and further expand the work on the DID method specification, to figure out how all the KERI building blocks can be utilized together in a method spec.
        * In the future, the roadmap also includes globally resolvable (anywise) identifiers.
        * Some questions are still open, e.g.: How is a did:keri globally resolvable? How do I know what are the witnesses? How exactly do you contact the witness? How are different key purposes mapped to a key event log? How can additional metadata be associated with a DID? How do you implement discoverability?
        * Does did:keri by itself make sense, or only "KERI in the context of an existing DID method" (e.g. did:indy:keri)?
    * Next steps
        * The work in the [KERI WG](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri) is in a special state. The goal is to "wrap" that current status of KERI so that the KERI spec work goes into a "sleep" state. There are two communities, one working in the Trust-over-IP Foundation (ToIP), one working at DIF.
        * The proposal is to contribute the KERI work itself to the [Applied Cryptography Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/), and the did:keri work to the [Identifiers & Discovery Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/) (this group).

5. [Liam McCarty, Unum ID] Bridging Digital and Physical: Make Identifiers Identify
    * **Summary:**
    * Identifiers are only useful if they identify, which requires them to be reliably associated with people and things. In this talk, Liam McCarty of [Unum ID](https://www.Unum.ID) will explain how to make such associations by leveraging the modern infrastructure of secure hardware and device biometrics. But he will also show that thereâ€™s currently a wide gap between how available this infrastructure is to different types of applications, and he will argue that this has been a significant barrier to adoption of decentralized identity systems. Finally, he will outline a path toward closing the gap and stress the importance of public advocacy in achieving that goal, which will finally make possible identifiers that identify.
    * **Notes:**
    * Association between physical world and digital identity is important.
    * In the physical world, we have "built-in private keys", we "are" a wallet.
    * There is a difference between access to hardware crypto on mobile vs. web.
    * Wallets in browsers are really hard, e.g. Safari deletes everything ter 1 week.
    * There is a need for generic hardware backed cryptographic signatures on the web.
    * Standards exist, but are of limited use:
        * WebAuthn allows access to hardware crypto, but only for authentication (no generic crypto operations): https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/
        * Web Crypto doesn't allow access to hardware crypto: https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/
    * Calling for community action to support this, e.g. see these issues:
        * https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1608
        * https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/issues/263
    * Some abandoned work on hardware based secure services:
        * https://www.w3.org/community/hb-secure-services/
        * https://rawgit.com/w3c/websec/gh-pages/hbss.html
    * **Call to Action:**
    * We need community action to advocate for general, hardware backed cryptographic signatures on the web! This would make it possible to build decentralized identity wallet web apps, not just mobile ones, dramatically improving odds of adoption. Please help the cause by commenting on the WebAuthn and WebCrypto GitHub issues pages, supporting my proposals there, and generally increasing awareness around this topic. This is a technical change that requires a decidedly nontechnical solution: community advocacy. Thanks for your help!

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Daniel] Historical key resolution
   * A DID document could point to a hub, which contains a list of historical keys associated with the DID. This list is signed by a current DID controller key.
   * Using DID URLs, it should be possible to point to a specific historical key at a specific point in time, and it can be dereferences publicly by anyone.
   * Maybe similar to this: `did:example:123?service=IdentityHub&relativeRef=/CollectionsQuery?uri=https://identity.foundatio/KeyHistory#key-32`
   * See https://identity.foundation/identity-hub/spec/#did-relative-urls
   * Discussion around how can this be trusted, since it's in your identity hub and you can change it at any time, and this information is separate from the underlying DID verifiable data registry.
   * Advantage: This is method-independent.
   * Discussion on relation between this approach and KERI's Key Event Logs.
   * Discussion on implementing this in the Universal Resolver. This could be supported as an extension of the UR; individual DID method drivers don't have to do anything.
   * The ID WG could start a new work item which defines the data structure of historical keys, as well as the format of DID URls that point to them.

4. Special Work Item Calls
   * Markus gave a quick update from the Special Work Item Calls about DID Registration and the Universal Resolver
5. [ezequiel] "controller" property in DID documents and verification methods.
   * "controller" on the top level seems clear, but on the "verificationMethod" is less clear.
   * "verificationMethod" can only have a single "controller", but verification methods can in fact be "controlled" by multiple entities (e.g. see the next topic - Verifiable Conditions)
   * See e.g. https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/697

7. Other topics?


*Discussion topic*: DID Document signatures
Samuel G.:

* DID Document owner signs the DID Document to protect the DID Document integrity.
* Purpose: to abstract the DID Registry implementation.
* The proof is static.
* The computation proof is automated.

Markus:

* The topic has been discussed many times.
* Outcome: DID Document signature by itself does not prove control of the DID.
* Only DID Document signature and anchoring (in a registry) can prove the actual ownership of the DID Document.

Alen: What is the added value of having a signature?

Samuel G.:

* DID Document integrity protection.
* Minimizing the technology dependence (of the registries).

Markus: 

* DID Document signature only assures the DID Document integrity and not the link between the DID and DID Document.
Ideally, you should run your own universal resolver and perform the full resolution.

*Discussion outcomes*:

* DID Documents may or may not require a signature, depending on the registry design.
* DID Document signature only proves the DID Document integrity.
* Only DID Document signature and anchoring (in a registry) can prove the actual ownership of the DID.
* Reliable DID resolution is important.

*Discussion topic*: DID key rotation and revocation

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. New Work Item Call schedule announced (DID Registration WI, Universal Resolver WI)
5. Universal Registrar - an overview
    - Universal Registrar - can obtaining access to registries be unified (from the wallet implementation perspective)?
      - References:
        - https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar
        - https://uniregistrar.io/
      - Issue:
        - Onboarding/getting access to a DID registry is usually DID-registry-specific.
      - Proposals:
        - Consider the most frequent flows:
          - Redirect to a webpage (authentication or other operations are performed outside the wallet)
          - Authentication via API (some existing Universal Registrar drivers support this)
        - Proposal should work for most DID methods (e.g., did:web, Sovrin, sidetree)
        - A more detailed compatibility analysis is required
       - Outcomes
           - Proposals will be further analysed and discussed in the Universal Registration call
           - Issues will be opened in the Universal Registration repository
6. Short discussion about DID key rotation/revocation
    - DID Key rotation/revocation and trust

5. Special Topic Calls: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/pull/1
   - Will discuss and find appropriate times via Slack/email.
6. [Boris Mann, Brooklyn Zelenka, Jeff Griffiths] Overview of Fission proposed approach to DID resolve / discovery in signing up for an account / linking DIDs
   - Fission's entire account system is built around DIDs.
   - App publishing platform and SDK.
   - Giving every user an end-to-end encrypted data store, using IPFS heavily.
   - In the account system, people select a username in a Fission namespace (e.g. boris.fission.name). The human-readable identifier can be used to discover a DID (using https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns/). A did:key is created for users. The Fission server also has a DID.
   - Are there privacy issues with using domain names as user identifiers?
   - How can the auth system accept "remote" DIDs, i.e. interoperate with other DID methods (e.g. did:ion)? The "remote" DID could then "control" the Fission-internal DID.
   - How can the auth system advertise to someone that they can enter a DID to connect to the system?
   - Considering Webfinger discovery based on email-like identifiers; want to avoid NASCAR problem.
   - OIDC SIOP work seems relevant (ongoing at OpenID Foundation).
   - IIW had a session about SIOP Chooser (see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OaMecHecTUexv1skJZoYzJoHKYH8H03REFpFstLRjPg/). Tom Jones is one of the people leading this effort.

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Breaking changes in DID Core JSON-LD context:
   - https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/pull/277
   - Strictly speaking, all UR DID method implementations are now broken.
   - Discussion around changing JSON-LD contexts, caching, versioning, hashlinks
   - UR could implement a "fixing layer" for a transitional period, and simultaneously try to motivate implementers to fix their drivers.
5. Universal Resolver policy questions about driver submission and maintenance
   - https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/issues/186
   - UR currently supports several DID methods that are not in the DID spec registries.
   - Probably we should have stricter policies going forward (e.g. only accept drivers for DID methods in the W3C method registry)
   - We will work on a proposal and present to the group.

4. [DanielK, JonC] New DID method on the Solana blockchain

   - did:solid, but not related to Solid (Social Linked Data) project
   - Solana blockchain is cheap and fast (1000s of transactions per dollar, but data storage is not as cheap). There is "rent", which can be decreased but never increased.
   - Version 0.1, will still be changed/optimized
   - Simple CRUD approach to put DIDs on blockchain. Solana has the concept of an "account", that's what you pay rent for. It will serialize a document and store the byte array on chain.
   - Daniel+Jon have worked on a driver for both the Universal Resolver and Universal Registrar. An instance of the Universal Resolver is running at:
   - https://did.civic.com/
   - Some discussion around design of Universal Registrar, e.g. what are the inputs, who pays for the transactions, etc.
   - [CharlesEL] Spruce Systems has also worked on a DID method based on Solana, perhaps there is potential to collaborate.

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Controller, verification methods, authorization in DID Core
   - See issues in DID Core: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/697, https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/693, https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/694, https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/695
5. [Jack] Support for multisig and delegation in EOSIO
   - Presentation by Jack about EOS chain and larger EOSIO ecosystem
   - EOS has an "account" concept as an abstraction layer; the account identifier is not derived from a key
   - Detailed discussions about multi-sig verification methods and delegation methods
   - There is a difference between 1. making a DID method that internally uses these features, and 2. exposing this in a DID document in a method-independent way. On the call, there was consensus that the latter would be highly desirable.
   - Consensus that a new cryptosuite should be defined (as a work item in W3C CCG or DIF)
   - If possible, the [`blockchainAccountId` property](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#blockchainaccountid) should be re-used.
6. Related topics in other DID methods
   - Besides EOS, this is also relevant to did:indy, Ripple, and KERI-based DID methods

   - Can use Universal Resolver as a fallback
   - Built-in DID resolution in browser is preferable to remote resolver service
5. Updates on Universal Resolver/Registrar
   - Working on a DIDComm interface for the Universal Resolver
   - Alternative to using HTTP interface
   - Chicken-and-egg problem (you first need to resolve DIDs to do DIDComm)
6. Discussion on human-readable names and DIDs
   - Existing specifications to link web addresses and domain names to DIDs: https://identity.foundation/specs/did-configuration/, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns/

4. News on [Fuzzy Encryption](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption):
   - Finished work on a C++ implementation
   - Build script that generates WASM, can be consumed by JS
   - When not in native C++ form, it needs a wrapper for input of random bytes
   - Library can encrypt secrets, can decrypt with different inputs; technically different from Shamir, but has similar properties
   - The encrypted secret can be a symmetric key seed
5. News on [KERI](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri):
   - KERI is about to become its own Working Group, charter has been approved
6. Guidance on specifying a new DID method
   - Interest in creating a new DID method for eos.io
   - eos.io has existing concepts of "accounts" that could be used as a basis for DIDs
   - How to write a DID method specification? (needs to define DID syntax, DID operations, Privacy&Security Considerations)
   - DID method can be registered in [DID Spec Registries](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/)

   - Introduction to DIDKit:
     - Support for Verifiable Credentials, LD Proofs, JSON-LD normalization, VC HTTP API, and more.
     - Support for multiple DID methods in core, library can be extended with additional DID methods by implementing the same Rust trait.
     - Rust traits match functionality in DID Core and DID Resolution.
     - Support for did:doge (identical to did:btcr with better privacy characteristics)
   - Discussion on architectures of DID registration software
     - Security and trust issues if a hosted service is involved in DID write operations.
     - User/client should not sign something they don't understand.
     - Startups create new DID methods all the time, how can they all be supported?
   - Discussion around government-approved cryptography, and adoption of DIDs.
5. Consider proof-of-control
   - Sam: We don't need DID documents, we only need to establish control authority, and then issue verifiable credentials.

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Integration between [ACA-py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/)/[Veramo](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo)/[aries-framework-go](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/) and [Universal Resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/).
   - DID write operations in aries-framework-go:
     - Supports did:web, did:key, did:peer, you can inject additional DID method support
     - Ability to configure Universal Resolver
     - For DID updates, you can pass in DID documents for doing updates (patches can be automatically constructed from the diff)
     - Using WebKMS ("KeyRetriever" interface) for write operations
   - DID write operations in Veramo:
     - Veramo acts as a store that links DIDs to their keys
     - DID that needs to be updated need some crypto operations with those keys
     - We tried to come up with an abstraction layer, including add and remove operations for keys and services
   - DID write operations in Universal Registrar:
     - https://uniregistrar.io/
     - Set of Docker images similar to Universal Resolver
     - Private keys are generated by the individual drivers and then returned to a client <-- bad security!!
     - API has state ("finished", "error", "action", "wait") and sometimes requires multiple steps
   - Discussion around "trusted endpoints" for DID methods
     - To add support for resolving a DID method, you could run a driver locally as part of the resolver, or configure a trusted remote endpoint
     - This can help minimize the amount of code that has be implemented

5. Review of current work items
   - Discussed state of did:peer with regard to recent developments in DIDComm v2 and KERI
   - KERI implementations are moving ahead in multiple programming languages.
   - Thanks @tmarkovski for new contribution of did:key implementation in Rust! https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs
6. Use of colons in DID syntax
   - E.g. in `did:ethr:testnet:1235426534`, you have a colon as part of the method-specific identifier. Does this mean you have to know about all DID methods in order to be able to parse DIDs?
   - See reviews by W3C TAG about DID Core spec: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/556

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. New implementations
   - **[Tomislav Markovski/Trinsic]** Rust implementation of did:key
     - Worked on DIDComm extensions, but separated them out to independent component
     - Initial keys: Those supported by DIDComm (Ed25519, P256)
     - did:key is very flexible to work with, not anchored, self-certifying, uses multicodec
     - Rust is good for native libraries that you can call from other platforms
     - No FFI layer yet, but it would be easy to expose if anyone wants to consume it
     - Functions: Resolve, generate, generate from seed, sign, verify, create DID document (currently supports JSON-LD but should also support plain JSON)
     - https://github.com/trinsic-id/did-key.rs
   - **[Juan Blanco/Nethereum, Veikko Eeva]** Planned .Net implementation work
     - Created a .Net implementation of Ethereum
     - Have followed DIDs but they are still work-in-progress
     - Have looked at Java and JavaScript implementations, there is still a lot to do
     - Joined DIF and are looking to collaborate with other people to get the ball rolling with a .Net implementation of DIDs
     - https://github.com/veikkoeeva/DotDecentralized/tree/main/src/DotDecentralized.Core
   - **[Alen Horvat/Aceblock]** Universal services
     - High level of universality and independence of underlying technologies is important, to avoid vendor lock-in
     - Universal Services: Standardize the way to interact with and access SSI services
     - Use DID Auth, REST endpoints for read, JSON-RPC endpoints for write
     - Read operations are standardized (Universal Resolver)
     - CUD operations are more complex; e.g. the service can return an unsigned payload, plus a request for signature
     - The solution is standardized arguments
     - The Universal Resolver currently is very heavy (lots of Docker containers); instead, it could call out to remotely hosted resolvers
     - There is need for a trust list of DID method endpoints; DIF could play a role here
   - **[Joel Thorstensson/3Box]** DID implementation in JavaScript
     - Introduced js-did library, based on EIP2844
     - Functions: did_authenticate, did_createJWS, did_decryptJWE
     - Support for ed25519, secp256k1, 3id
     - js-did library uses https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver
     - Also methods for dag-jose
     - Runs in any JavaScript environment (client, server)

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Admin: Set up WG team members on Github: https://github.com/orgs/decentralized-identity/teams/id-wg
   - See list of repos: https://github.com/orgs/decentralized-identity/teams/id-wg/repositories
5. Key roll-over and recovery
   - We should create a repo in the ID WG that lists recovery methods we know about.
   - Microsoft/DanielB have been working on Fuzzy Encryption: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption
   - For the [Confidential Storage (CS) WG](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage), key recovery is pretty much out of scope. You can store private keys in a CS, but you still need a master key to unlock the CS, so there's a chicken and egg problem.
   - There is essentially only a limited set of options (menmonic devices, secret sharing). Usability is the main issue; we need a critical mass of people working on it, to make the user experience accessible.
   - Biometrics must not be used as a primary private key ("you can't rotate biometrics"). Biometrics can be used to unlock a private key, i.e. as an authorization capability.
   - Additional topic: How can keys be recovered when you are not capable of controlling them anymore, or after your death?
6. Topics seen in Slack channel:
   - Universal Wallet Conceptual Clarifications - https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec/issues/46

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Discussion of Method Spec Registry analytics and some possible directions for DIF-based efforts to structure DID Method comparison/review (Juan)
   - What's the current process for getting a DID method added to the [W3C DID spec registries](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods)? What's the governance process?
   - Orie explained that the editors check if the link works, and if the DID method spec contains the required sections.
   - All methods are currently marked either "provisional" or "deprecated".
   - Maybe methods that don't fulfill the current requirements should be marked somehow (but this could be politically sensitive).
   - Some methods were created before there even was a registry.
   - Markus has worked on a graph that shows DID methods added over time.
   - Sam suggested to do analytics of DID method usage.
   - Potentially access logs of the Universal Resolver can be analyzed (but it doesn't have any built-in analytics).
   - What's the current governance process for adding a driver to the DIF Universal Resolver?
   - There is a [page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/driver-development.md) that describes requirements, but the process can definitely be improved, e.g. by automatically testing drivers.
   - How can method spec authors and/or resolver driver implementers be contacted if their DID method (implementation) is outdated or doesn't work?
   - Sophie suggested that authors/implementers should be asked to supply contact information (rather than trying to find them by their Github handle).
5. Discussion around accessibility/usability of DID technology
   - Eric noted that after taking a break from participating in the DID community, it felt hard to get back to the topic and find the inside knowledge that's required to use DIDs.
   - Many DID methods seem to be "dead", and some method specifications have "TBD" sections. Therefore people may stay away from DIDs.
   - Some DID methods are designed to be easy to use without a need for advanced infrastructure (e.g. did:web, did:key).
   - Sam explained that one objective of KERI is replace many DID methods with a single DID method.
   - Sophie agreed that it was hard to find things, there are too many documents and some broken links.
   - Eric suggested it would be good to have third-party journalistic review of DID methods.
6. Short process-related discussion about recent DID Core spec proposal related to canonical/equivalent IDs.

## Meeting - 23 Nov 2020 - (1400 ET) [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/K_AYd9_MpoBIbXUXq6TxwvkH2_-edUlzf22WDrJ0nn2_4Rv5O0Ok6Q6MBnUVoLE0.qoT43iXVZBPxkk4V)

### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Questions around DID deactivation and resolution metadata
   - Can you verify a credential that was signed by a DID that has been deactivated?
   - Yes you can look up older versions of a DID document using the `version_id` and `version_time` parameters.
   - But support for those parameters, as well as support for deactivating DIDs, is method-specific and optional.
   - Support for looking up old DID document may be infeasible, considering the expected amount of DIDs, if you have to keep a copy of everything.
   - Sidetree has a "checkpoint" feature that deletes old history at some point.
5. MIME types of DID documents
   - Is it legal to have multiple `+` symbols like in `application/did+ld+json`? See discussion here: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/208
6. Update on issues with WebID: https://tcwiki.azurewebsites.net/index.php?title=Authentication_UX
   - WebID came up at BlinkOn (a browser conference), slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rOIKWSrL8acz-rl8PRHmPvS5f6fOl7-tQwByT6O595A/
   - We (DIF) should work web WebID to get DID support into browsers.
   - This is an opportunity to get smooth and "in context" support for having a direct connection to the wallet (sending requests and responses).
   - Can WebAuthn be used for this? It offers a direct connection from a browser to a trusted wallet.

### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Sam] Collect use cases for KERI
   - Time: the hour before the developer meeting
   - Send use cases to Sam or Juan
5. Status of the DID rubric PR that adds security and privacy criteria:
   - https://github.com/w3c/did-rubric/pull/11
6. [Markus] Open PRs in DID Core about the abstract data model and reprsentations:
   - https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/455
   - https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/454
7. How will the Universal Resolver support different representations?
   - It should delegate as much as possible to its drivers.
   - The Universal Resolver can also "convert" between representations, but should indicate that it did this, and a client should be able to control this behavior via input metadata properties.
   - Need to define how the "Accept" header works in the HTTP(S) binding.
   - Should the "default behavior" be to return a DID document, or a DID resolution result (which includes the DID document plus metadata).
   - Need to update the Universal Resolver [driver development documentation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/driver-development.md), as well as the [DID Resolution spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/).
8. [Orie, Sam] Any progress on KERI test vectors? Things are still changing too much.
9. Updates on current work items
   did:peer, KERI, Universal Resolver, .well-known DID configuration, DID
   parameters, secret recovery mechanisms

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Markus] I&D WG resources and work items: [Website](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html), [Github](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/dif/Identifiers-Discovery-Working-Group-aea2c07cc10d4f45b729b633691e364e)
5. [All] Impressions from Internet Identity Workshop #31
6. From IIW: did:indy https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw
   - What does the namespace look like? E.g. did:indy:897347:2498237498374982374
   - Is the "controller" the wallet?
7. Websites and browser
   - How would a website know what to ask for, e.g. in OIDC SIOP?
   - The website wants the user's identity, how does that connect to the controller?
   - What does the website send to the browser to initiate the process?
   - The user would send an identifier plus a proof of authority..
   - What should be our next steps regarding WebID? (see notes from last week)
   - At IIW there were sessions about WebID and its relation to CHAPI and SIOP
   - CHAPI is a "dumb pipe" that can be used for sending get() and store() requests. Wallets are registered via a polyfill (uses localStorage). There are some privacy/confidentiality/usability issues with polyfill.
   - Volunteers to collaborate on a statement from DIF about WebID?
8. [Daniel] Implementation updates
   - Implementing .well-known now, wallets that will connect to it by the end of the year
   - Python implementation of Fuzzy Vault is available now: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption/tree/master/src/python
   - Implementing WASM bundle now in ~2 months, then publish a blog post?
9. [Wayne] From IIW: Opt-in discovery rather than passive discovery by Daniel Hardman
10. [Markus and all] Current topics in DID Core spec
    - DID document representations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHw7QfGBbJrr4okIdxDbDRhHJHJJLmzE/, also see various issues and PRs on DID WG Github repos.
    - 'type' property: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/410
    - W3C TPAC meeting is happening now
    - [Sam] Differentiate between "privacy" and "confidentiality". Privacy is one-way; confidentiality can be preserved long-term. Trilemma: Authenticity/privacy/confidentiality.
11. [Tom] Security of keys in a wallet, is this covered by the DID Core spec?
12. Updates on current work items
    did:peer, KERI, Universal Resolver, .well-known DID configuration, DID
    parameters, secret recovery mechanisms
