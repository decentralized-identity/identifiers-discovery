### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. New implementations
   * **[Tomislav Markovski/Trinsic]** Rust implementation of did:key
       * Worked on DIDComm extensions, but separated them out to independent component
       * Initial keys: Those supported by DIDComm (Ed25519, P256)
       * did:key is very flexible to work with, not anchored, self-certifying, uses multicodec
       * Rust is good for native libraries that you can call from other platforms
       * No FFI layer yet, but it would be easy to expose if anyone wants to consume it
       * Functions: Resolve, generate, generate from seed, sign, verify, create DID document (currently supports JSON-LD but should also support plain JSON)
       * https://github.com/trinsic-id/did-key.rs
   * **[Juan Blanco/Nethereum, Veikko Eeva]** Planned .Net implementation work
       * Created a .Net implementation of Ethereum
       * Have followed DIDs but they are still work-in-progress
       * Have looked at Java and JavaScript implementations, there is still a lot to do
       * Joined DIF and are looking to collaborate with other people to get the ball rolling with a .Net implementation of DIDs
       * https://github.com/veikkoeeva/DotDecentralized/tree/main/src/DotDecentralized.Core
   * **[Alen Horvat/Aceblock]** Universal services
       * High level of universality and independence of underlying technologies is important, to avoid vendor lock-in
       * Universal Services: Standardize the way to interact with and access SSI services
       * Use DID Auth, REST endpoints for read, JSON-RPC endpoints for write
       * Read operations are standardized (Universal Resolver)
       * CUD operations are more complex; e.g. the service can return an unsigned payload, plus a request for signature
       * The solution is standardized arguments 
       * The Universal Resolver currently is very heavy (lots of Docker containers); instead, it could call out to remotely hosted resolvers
       * There is need for a trust list of DID method endpoints; DIF could play a role here
   * **[Joel Thorstensson/3Box]** DID implementation in JavaScript
       * Introduced js-did library, based on EIP2844
       * Functions: did_authenticate, did_createJWS, did_decryptJWE
       * Support for ed25519, secp256k1, 3id
       * js-did library uses https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver
       * Also methods for dag-jose
       * Runs in any JavaScript environment (client, server)

## Meeting - 07 Dec 2020 - (1400 ET) [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/iSfQWY8wFde7nkHLCfwkBiInSNf3y5F0xRWnm-maiAwM9-9SzibpGA2S6t6mpgwa.Fig4sivvsP8Jj8_2)
 
### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Admin: Set up WG team members on Github: https://github.com/orgs/decentralized-identity/teams/id-wg
    * See list of repos: https://github.com/orgs/decentralized-identity/teams/id-wg/repositories
5. Key roll-over and recovery
    * We should create a repo in the ID WG that lists recovery methods we know about.
    * Microsoft/DanielB have been working on Fuzzy Encryption: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption
    * For the [Confidential Storage (CS) WG](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage), key recovery is pretty much out of scope. You can store private keys in a CS, but you still need a master key to unlock the CS, so there's a chicken and egg problem.
    * There is essentially only a limited set of options (menmonic devices, secret sharing). Usability is the main issue; we need a critical mass of people working on it, to make the user experience accessible.
    * Biometrics must not be used as a primary private key ("you can't rotate biometrics"). Biometrics can be used to unlock a private key, i.e. as an authorization capability.
    * Additional topic: How can keys be recovered when you are not capable of controlling them anymore, or after your death?
6. Topics seen in Slack channel:
    * Universal Wallet Conceptual Clarifications - https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec/issues/46
    * Universal Registrar problem: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar/issues/18

## Meeting - 30 Nov 2020 - (1400 ET) [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/XObP9jPhKL--j-7XlCuVeaAmpNJ9Ky-abUN9xbJ8wkqBlF77PJE9oYON28iqQbLN.pApDPAP50qLUlCKo)
 
### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Discussion of Method Spec Registry analytics and some possible directions for DIF-based efforts to structure DID Method comparison/review (Juan)
    *  What's the current process for getting a DID method added to the [W3C DID spec registries](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods)? What's the governance process?
    *  Orie explained that the editors check if the link works, and if the DID method spec contains the required sections.
    *  All methods are currently marked either "provisional" or "deprecated". 
    *  Maybe methods that don't fulfill the current requirements should be marked somehow (but this could be politically sensitive).
    *  Some methods were created before there even was a registry.
    *  Markus has worked on a graph that shows DID methods added over time.
    *  Sam suggested to do analytics of DID method usage.
    *  Potentially access logs of the Universal Resolver can be analyzed (but it doesn't have any built-in analytics).
    *  What's the current governance process for adding a driver to the DIF Universal Resolver?
    *  There is a [page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/driver-development.md) that describes requirements, but the process can definitely be improved, e.g. by automatically testing drivers.
    *  How can method spec authors and/or resolver driver implementers be contacted if their DID method (implementation) is outdated or doesn't work?
    *  Sophie suggested that authors/implementers should be asked to supply contact information (rather than trying to find them by their Github handle).
5. Discussion around accessibility/usability of DID technology
    * Eric noted that after taking a break from participating in the DID community, it felt hard to get back to the topic and find the inside knowledge that's required to use DIDs.
    * Many DID methods seem to be "dead", and some method specifications have "TBD" sections. Therefore people may stay away from DIDs.
    * Some DID methods are designed to be easy to use without a need for advanced infrastructure (e.g. did:web, did:key).
    * Sam explained that one objective of KERI is replace many DID methods with a single DID method.
    * Sophie agreed that it was hard to find things, there are too many documents and some broken links.
    * Eric suggested it would be good to have third-party journalistic review of DID methods.
6. Short process-related discussion about recent DID Core spec proposal related to canonical/equivalent IDs.

## Meeting - 23 Nov 2020 - (1400 ET) [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/K_AYd9_MpoBIbXUXq6TxwvkH2_-edUlzf22WDrJ0nn2_4Rv5O0Ok6Q6MBnUVoLE0.qoT43iXVZBPxkk4V)
 
### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Questions around DID deactivation and resolution metadata
    * Can you verify a credential that was signed by a DID that has been deactivated?
    * Yes you can look up older versions of a DID document using the `version_id` and `version_time` parameters.
    * But support for those parameters, as well as support for deactivating DIDs, is method-specific and optional.
    * Support for looking up old DID document may be infeasible, considering the expected amount of DIDs, if you have to keep a copy of everything.
    * Sidetree has a "checkpoint" feature that deletes old history at some point.
5. MIME types of DID documents
    * Is it legal to have multiple `+` symbols like in `application/did+ld+json`? See discussion here: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/208
6. Update on issues with WebID: https://tcwiki.azurewebsites.net/index.php?title=Authentication_UX
    * WebID came up at BlinkOn (a browser conference), slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rOIKWSrL8acz-rl8PRHmPvS5f6fOl7-tQwByT6O595A/
    * We (DIF) should work web WebID to get DID support into browsers.
    * This is an opportunity to get smooth and "in context" support for having a direct connection to the wallet (sending requests and responses).
    * Can WebAuthn be used for this? It offers a direct connection from a browser to a trusted wallet.

## Meeting - 16 Nov 2020 - (1400 ET) [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/D0m7Zk6UjriFJ9wxh5FM_yIG6GfHSEi1rgVVv-lViyFXjPa7XCC0tCP512D8Vz1v.cYtgFmIhkpYrfl7q)
 
### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Sam] Collect use cases for KERI
   * Time: the hour before the developer meeting
   * Send use cases to Sam or Juan
5. Status of the DID rubric PR that adds security and privacy criteria:
   * https://github.com/w3c/did-rubric/pull/11
6. [Markus] Open PRs in DID Core about the abstract data model and reprsentations:
   * https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/455
   * https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/454
7. How will the Universal Resolver support different representations?
   * It should delegate as much as possible to its drivers.
   * The Universal Resolver can also "convert" between representations, but should indicate that it did this, and a client should be able to control this behavior via input metadata properties.
   * Need to define how the "Accept" header works in the HTTP(S) binding.
   * Should the "default behavior" be to return a DID document, or a DID resolution result (which includes the DID document plus metadata).
   * Need to update the Universal Resolver [driver development documentation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/driver-development.md), as well as the [DID Resolution spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/).
8. [Orie, Sam] Any progress on KERI test vectors? Things are still changing too much.

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. [Markus] I&D WG resources and work items: [Website](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html), [Github](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/dif/Identifiers-Discovery-Working-Group-aea2c07cc10d4f45b729b633691e364e)
5. [All] Impressions from Internet Identity Workshop #31
6. From IIW: did:indy https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw
    - What does the namespace look like? E.g. did:indy:897347:2498237498374982374
    - Is the "controller" the wallet?
7. Websites and browser
    - How would a website know what to ask for, e.g. in OIDC SIOP? 
    - The website wants the user's identity, how does that connect to the controller?
    - What does the website send to the browser to initiate the process?
    - The user would send an identifier plus a proof of authority..
    - What should be our next steps regarding WebID? (see notes from last week)
    - At IIW there were sessions about WebID and its relation to CHAPI and SIOP
    - CHAPI is a "dumb pipe" that can be used for sending get() and store() requests. Wallets are registered via a polyfill (uses localStorage). There are some privacy/confidentiality/usability issues with polyfill.
    - Volunteers to collaborate on a statement from DIF about WebID?
7. [Daniel]Â Implementation updates
    - Implementing .well-known now, wallets that will connect to it by the end of the year
    - Python implementation of Fuzzy Vault is available now: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption/tree/master/src/python
    - Implementing WASM bundle now in ~2 months, then publish a blog post?
8. [Wayne] From IIW: Opt-in discovery rather than passive discovery by Daniel Hardman
9. [Markus and all] Current topics in DID Core spec
    - DID document representations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHw7QfGBbJrr4okIdxDbDRhHJHJJLmzE/, also see various issues and PRs on DID WG Github repos.
    - 'type' property: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/410
    - W3C TPAC meeting is happening now
    - [Sam] Differentiate between "privacy" and "confidentiality". Privacy is one-way; confidentiality can be preserved long-term. Trilemma: Authenticity/privacy/confidentiality.
10. [Tom] Security of keys in a wallet, is this covered by the DID Core spec?
11. Updates on current work items
	did:peer, KERI, Universal Resolver, .well-known DID configuration, DID
	parameters, secret recovery mechanisms
