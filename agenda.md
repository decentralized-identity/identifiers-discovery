### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. [ID WG participation tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=1245330243)
3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Work item updates
5. Live working session on https://identity.foundation/.well-known/did.json and
   https://identity.foundation/.well-known/did-configuration.json
   1. The "Well Known DID Configuration" is in this repo:
      https://github.com/decentralized-identity/.well-known
   2. DIF's website is in this repo:
      https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io
   3. The repo in 1. also contains these files:
      - "did.json", this is used for DIF's own example DID
        did:web:identity.foundation
      - "did-configuration.json", this is used of DIF's own "Well Known DID
        Configuration", i.e. to link DIF's DIF to DIF's domain name.
   4. We agreed that these two files "did.json" and "did-configuration.json"
      should be moved from the repo in 1. to the repo in 2.
   5. We agreed that the repo in 1. is currently published at a path that feels
      a bit strange:
      https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/, and
      that therefore the repo should be renamed, e.g. to
      "well-known-did-configuration".
   6. We agreed that DIF's "did-configuration.json" file should be updated to
      link to a DID other than the current did:key one. It could for example
      link to the DID did:web:identity.foundation, or another one that we
      create.
   7. We agreed that DIF's "did.json" file should be updated to contain a
      service endpoint according to the Linked VP specification, i.e. to enable
      discovery of a VP from the DID. This VP could simply contain a single
      self-asserted VC.
   8. Identinet has a well-developed setup of all these concepts, so we can use
      this as an example:
      - https://identinet.io/.well-known/did.json
      - https://identinet.io/.well-known/did-configuration.json

3. Agenda creation/review/prioritization
4. Work item updates
   - DID Traits work item: next meeting on 18 March. Next steps are the
     integration into the DID Extensions Repository and also the pursuit of
     version 1.0 of the specification.
5. [Snorre] DID methods backed by biometrics
   - Snorre shares that his employers has technology to deterministically
     generate a private key from a face. He wonders how this functionality could
     be linked to the SSI ecosystem.
   - The technology can work with all kinds of biometric inputs, e.g. also
     fingers.
   - Feedback: representing humanness could be done using Verifiable
     Credentials, e.g.
     [Personhood Credentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07892).
   - Feedback: the private key generation is a unique feature that might be
     valuable for key management.

4. Work item updates
   - did:webvh meeting coming up on Thursday. Implementation is under way.
     Agenda ot the meeting: https://hackmd.io/k4cIK9vQSlaeg2pdHE51IQ
5. (Markus) Update from DID Methods WG:
   https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/
   - DID method standardization has started.
   - [DID method selection criteria](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/tree/main/selection-criteria)
     for and proposals for
     [DID method standardization](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/tree/main/method-proposals)
6. (JC and Markus) Planned townhall meeting and outlook for 2025
   - Proposal of holding a townhall meeting on 27 Jan, instead of the bi-weekly
     meeting.
   - The goal is to look back on 2024 and look forward to 2025 to identify new
     work items and bring together people with common intrests from our working
     group.
   - Jan Christoph's interest is to build real-world applications that use DIDs.
7. (Ben Taylor, Victor Dods) Update on did:webplus
   - Slides:
     https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dnQHCe_E3ACdUDN5GCLIEsyrYI4ohaiazOi3Deh7Muw/edit?usp=sharing
   - did:web starting point - it doesn't meet the requirements of long-term
     verifiablity, availability and non-repudiability.
   - Goal: create a "strong" DID method that meets the requirements that are
     relevant to the health care industry (https://www.oc-i.org/).
   - Resolution works like did:web.
   - Identifier is self-certifying.
   - Components:
     - DID Document Store, low-level component that exists creates a
       micro-ledger for a DID Document and can detect if multiple concurrent
       versions (forks) exist at the same time. Used by the VDR and the VDG
     - Verifiable Data Gateway (VDG): Large-scale caching of DID documments. Has
       a consensus algorithm to synchronize changes between VDGs. Small number
       of VDGs exist that are run by neutral organizations.
   - Implementations for all the components exist:
     https://github.com/LedgerDomain/did-webplus/
   - There is no official specification, yet.
8. (JC) DID Traits submission for review by working group

- The DID Traits work item is ready for submission and will be submitted to the
  working group in the next few days.
